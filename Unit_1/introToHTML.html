        <div>
            - h1: heading ~ these range from h1-h6, the text gets smaller as the number increases. <br>
            - div: division ~ helps keep things organized <br>
            - br: break ~ separation <br>
            - p: paragraph ~ text element <br>
            - img: provides us an element to an image (self-closing) <br>
            - span: allows us to write a block of text without line breaks
        </div>

        <h2>Sample h2</h2>
        <h3>Sample h3</h3>
        <p>Here is a paragraph element!</p>
        <!-- Using emmet, we can inject "lorem" and hit tab to populate a block of text. You can specify that you want a certain number of words in the example text by typing "lorem#". For example, typing "lorem100" and pressing enter will give you 100 words of example text. -->
